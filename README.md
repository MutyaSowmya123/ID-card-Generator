# ID-card-Generator
A pdf of ID cards will be generated from csv file (consisting of names, positions and location of photos) and photos directory.

I considered randomly generated sample data.
Added photo paths to the photos column in the csv file.

when I run the code the the id cards pdf will be generated and saved in my project folder.
